# Someplace Else

Someplace Else is a web app that lets users anonymously share and discover chill spots around UF's campus and the general Gainesville area. Whether it's a park, a café, or a bench with a great view, this project is built to bring people together by sharing the places that bring them peace. With this app, users can leave a little piece of themselves behind: an anonymous pinpoint of memories for others to discover.

At its core, Someplace Else is a project aimed at promoting stress relief and connection. It’s a small way to remind people that there are still calm, beautiful places waiting to be discovered.

## **Features**
- **Drop Pinpoints**: Users can drop anonymous pinpoints on a map, along with descriptions and optional photos of the location.
- **Explore Spots**: View pinpoints from other users, including the photos and descriptions they’ve shared.
- **Anonymity**: No sign-ups or logins; just share and explore freely.

## **Technologies and Frameworks**
- **React.js**: Used to build the frontend
- **Leaflet.js**: Library used for rendering and managing the map on the frontend
- **AWS Lambda**: In progress — developing serverless backend logic for handling API requests.
- **AWS API Gateway**: In progress — configuring to manage API endpoints and connect the frontend to the backend.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: In progress — setting up to store pinpoints, including coordinates, descriptions, and photos.
- **GitHub Pages**: In progress — preparing to host the frontend and make the application publicly accessible.
- **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**: Core languages for developing the frontend and backend logic


## **How It Works**
**Adding a Pinpoint**:
   - Click anywhere on the map within the boundary.
   - Add a description and an optional photo to share the moment.
   - Submit, and your pinpoint is saved anonymously.

**Viewing Others' Pinpoints**:
   - View pinpoints from others on the map.
   - Click on a pinpoint marker to see the description and any accompanying photo.
